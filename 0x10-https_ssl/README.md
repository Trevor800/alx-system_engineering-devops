HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are related but distinct technologies used to secure internet communications.
In summary, HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, and it uses SSL/TLS to encrypt and protect data transmitted between a client (your web browser) and a server (a website). This encryption is crucial for ensuring the privacy and security of online transactions, login credentials, and other sensitive information exchanged over the internet.
